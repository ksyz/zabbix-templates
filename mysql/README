THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS.

Provided template is just a stub. You need to regenerate it (and it still 
may not fit your needs):

 export $SFFX=clients
 perl trnsfrm.pl mysql_t.xml $SFFX > mysql_$SFFX.xml
 perl trnsfrm.pl mysql_t.xml > mysql.xml

Zabbix agent user parameters:

 UserParameter=mysql-nx.daily,php /usr/local/bin/mysql_monitor.php daily socket=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld-nx.sock user=root sufix=nx
 UserParameter=mysql-nx.live,php /usr/local/bin/mysql_monitor.php live socket=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld-nx.sock user=root sufix=nx

Suffix is needed, if you plan to asign template to host multiple times, to 
monitor more instances of mysql. Template also needs to be adjusted to 
reflect current suffix (or no suffix).

Note, that if you run this script as root, it will create several files 
in '/tmp' not writeble by user running zabbix-agentd, and gathering will 
fail.
